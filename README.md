# Yogapratishthan — Iyengar Yoga Center Management System

An admin tool that replaces the paper admission register and attendance book
for a single-instructor yoga studio. Built primarily for one person — the
instructor, running the whole center from a phone or tablet between classes —
with one deliberate public surface: a self-service admission form (`/apply`)
students fill in themselves, which lands in an admin inbox for review.
Everything else (the student list, attendance, vacations, reminders) sits
behind a login.

## What this actually does

Every class an instructor teaches, every student's attendance, every make-up
class, every holiday closure, every renewal — all of it used to live in a
physical register. This app digitizes that whole workflow:

- **Public admission form** (`/apply`) — a prospective student fills in their
  own Personal + Health Information (plus an optional photo and Aadhar card)
  from any device, no login required. It lands as a pending **Admission
  Request** for the instructor to review.
- **Admission Requests inbox** — the instructor reviews a submission, assigns
  a batch, and fills in payment/session details to complete the admission —
  at which point the app generates the student's entire session schedule
  automatically (e.g. "12 sessions, Mon & Thu" becomes 12 actual calendar
  dates). Admins can also admit a student directly without going through
  `/apply`.
- **Edit-access delegation** — the instructor can generate a one-off link
  (`/edit/{token}`) that lets a specific student update their own Personal +
  Health Information — never their batch, payment, or sessions — or just edit
  it herself from the student's profile.
- **Document export** — download a student's full submitted form, including
  their Aadhar card, as a clean printable page (browser "Print → Save as
  PDF").
- **Attendance register** (`/attendance`) — a spreadsheet-style register per
  batch: pick a month from the sidebar, see every student who had a class
  that month as a row and every class date as a column, and mark
  present/absent/vacation directly in the grid — no more opening students one
  at a time.
- **Make-ups** — add a make-up class for a missed session; it auto-expires
  after 2 months if unused.
- **Vacations** — declare a center-wide closure (Diwali, maintenance, etc.)
  *or* a single student's individual time off from their own profile —
  either way, every affected session automatically reschedules to the next
  valid class. No student loses a session, and no manual per-student work.
- **Reminders & notifications** — low sessions, expired memberships, expiring
  make-ups, birthdays, consecutive absences, and new admission requests
  surface automatically, with a one-tap WhatsApp reminder you can send
  straight from the app.
- **Renewals** — extend a student's schedule with another batch of sessions
  that continues seamlessly from where they left off.

## Architecture

**Monorepo** (pnpm workspaces):

```
yogapratishthan/
├── apps/web/          Next.js 15 app — the entire product (UI + API routes)
└── packages/db/       Prisma schema, generated client, seed script
```

**Why a separate `db` package** rather than Prisma living inside `apps/web`:
database access is isolated behind one boundary (`@yogapratishthan/db`), so
nothing outside `packages/db` ever imports `@prisma/client` directly. Every
feature reaches the database exclusively through a `services/*.ts` file.

**Tech stack:**

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript (strict) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui (Base UI primitives) |
| Forms | React Hook Form + Zod (one schema, shared by client and API) |
| Database | PostgreSQL (Neon in production) |
| ORM | Prisma 6 |
| File storage | Cloudflare R2 (production) / local disk (dev) — Vercel Blob also supported |
| Hosting | Render (also deployable to Vercel) |
| Notifications | Sonner (toasts) + an in-app event log (see below) |

**Layering, strictly enforced throughout:**

```
UI component  →  API route (thin)  →  service (business logic)  →  Prisma
```

API routes never contain business logic — they parse/validate the request
with Zod and call a service function. Services never touch `req`/`res` — they
take plain arguments and return plain data, so they're callable from any
route, from each other, or from a script.

## The Session Engine — the part that matters

The single most important architectural decision in this app: **a student's
sessions are never a number you decrement.**

The obvious-but-wrong design is a `remainingSessions` counter on the student
that goes down by one every time they attend. It seems simpler, right up
until you need to handle a missed class, a center holiday, or a renewal — at
which point you're patching counter arithmetic in five different places and
the number silently drifts out of sync with reality.

Instead, purchasing sessions **generates actual `Session` rows up front** —
one per class, each with a real calendar date. Every subsequent event
mutates that table instead of a summary number:

- **Attendance** marks a `Session` `PRESENT` or `ABSENT`.
- **A make-up** creates a *new* `Session` row linked back to the absence it
  replaces (`originalSessionId`), with a 2-month expiry.
- **A vacation** marks every affected `Session` `VACATION` and generates a
  replacement row on the next valid class date — the same linking mechanism
  a make-up uses, because they're the same concept: *"this session replaces
  that one."*
- **A renewal** generates another batch of `Session` rows continuing
  straight on from the student's last one.

Because everything is one source of truth, "how many sessions does this
student have left" is always a live query, never a cached value that can
drift:

```
purchased  = numberOfSessions (admission) + Σ renewals.numberOfSessions
completed  = count(status = PRESENT)
lost       = count(status = EXPIRED)      — make-ups that expired unused
remaining  = max(0, purchased − completed − lost)
```

This is also why deleting or editing a vacation is safe: reverting means
walking the same `originalSessionId` links backward, deleting the
replacement session and restoring the original — but *only* if that
replacement hasn't been attended yet. If it has, the real attendance record
is left alone rather than rewriting history. (See
`packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma` for the full `Session` model and
`apps/web/src/features/session-engine/` for the engine itself.)

**Timezone correctness.** Postgres `@db.Date` columns store pure calendar
dates as UTC midnight; naive local-time date arithmetic (`date-fns`'s
`addDays`/`startOfDay`) silently shifts dates by a day on any server not
running in UTC. Every place that touches a `scheduledDate` or vacation range
goes through `apps/web/src/lib/calendar-date.ts`, which does all date math in
UTC explicitly. This bit us once during development (Monday classes were
landing on Sunday) — see git history if you're curious.

## Data model

```
Batch             A recurring class slot (weekdays, start/end time). Seeded once.
Student           Personal + admission info. joiningDate anchors the schedule start.
                  aadharUrl + editAccessToken support the two features below.
Session           The source of truth — see above.
Renewal           A subsequent purchase of sessions.
Vacation          A center-wide closure (start date, end date, reason).
StudentVacation   Same shape as Vacation, scoped to one student — entered on
                  their profile, reschedules only their sessions.
AdmissionRequest  A public /apply submission awaiting admin review (PENDING /
                  ACCEPTED / REJECTED). Becomes a Student once accepted.
Note              Freeform notes on a student (health, scheduling, payment, etc.)
Event             Append-only activity log — powers both the student Timeline
                  and the notification bell. Every notable action writes one.
```

The `Event` model is deliberately the single hook point for anything
event-driven: notifications, the student timeline, and — when it's wired up —
outbound WhatsApp/email triggers all read from (or write to) this one table
instead of each inventing their own mechanism.

Full schema: `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`.

## Authentication

Single shared admin password — no per-user accounts, matching the
single-instructor scale of the rest of the app. `apps/web/src/middleware.ts`
blocks every route except an explicit public allowlist
(`/apply`, `/edit/{token}`, `/login`, `/reset-password`, and the API routes
those pages call) behind a signed session cookie. Logging in at `/login`
checks the submitted password and sets an HMAC-signed cookie
(`apps/web/src/lib/admin-session.ts`, Web Crypto `crypto.subtle` so it works
in either an Edge or Node middleware runtime — no session store, no extra
dependency).

**The password itself is DB-backed, not a fixed env var.** `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
is only a *bootstrap* value for a brand-new deployment that's never had its
password changed. "Forgot password?" on `/login` (or "Change password" once
signed in) emails a one-time reset link — via Gmail SMTP, `apps/web/src/lib/mailer.ts`
— to one hardcoded address (`ADMIN_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` in that file, not
user-suppliable at request time), which is what makes the flow safe to expose
without being logged in: only whoever controls that inbox can ever complete a
reset. The first successful reset writes a scrypt-hashed password
(`apps/web/src/lib/password-hash.ts` — Node's built-in `crypto.scrypt`, no
extra dependency) to the singleton `AdminCredential` row, which is checked
before `ADMIN_PASSWORD` from then on.

Student self-edit links (`/edit/{token}`) are a *separate*, narrower
mechanism — a random per-student token (`Student.editAccessToken`, generated
from the student's profile) that only ever unlocks that one student's
Personal + Health Information, never batch/payment/session fields, and
never grants access to anything else in the app.

Every feature folder follows the same internal shape: `components/`,
`services/` (server-only, Prisma access lives here and nowhere else),
`hooks/` (client-side data fetching), and a `schema.ts` (Zod, shared by the
client form and the API route that consumes it).

## Local development

**Prerequisites:** Node 20+, pnpm, a local PostgreSQL instance (or point
`DATABASE_URL` at Neon).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krishna2700/yogapratishthan.git
cd yogapratishthan
pnpm install                 # also runs `prisma generate` via postinstall
```

Set `DATABASE_URL` in **both**:
- `packages/db/.env` (used by the Prisma CLI)
- `apps/web/.env.local` (used by the running Next.js app — see note below)

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user@localhost:5432/yogapratishthan?schema=public"
```

> **Why both files?** Prisma bakes a relative path to `packages/db/.env` into
> the generated client for CLI use, but the Next.js dev server only loads env
> files from `apps/web/`. Setting it in both avoids ever hitting a live
> database by accident when you only meant to touch local dev — this is why
> local dev and the deployed app use *different* databases (local Postgres
> vs. the deployed Neon instance) unless you deliberately point both at the
> same one.

```bash
pnpm db:push      # sync the schema to your database
pnpm db:seed       # seed the 4 batches (Batch A–D)
pnpm dev           # http://localhost:3000
```

No `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is needed locally — photo uploads fall back to
`apps/web/public/uploads` automatically when that variable isn't set.

**Other useful scripts** (run from the repo root):

```bash
pnpm typecheck     # tsc --noEmit across both packages
pnpm lint          # eslint
pnpm build         # production build (also regenerates the Prisma client)
pnpm db:studio     # Prisma Studio — browse the database visually
```

## Deployment

Database is Neon Postgres regardless of where the app itself runs. File
storage is Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible, works from any host — not tied to
whichever platform runs the app) with Vercel Blob still supported as an
alternative. `apps/web/src/lib/file-storage.ts` picks between them by
whichever env vars are set: R2 first, then Vercel Blob, then local disk
(dev only — every host this app targets has an ephemeral filesystem in
production, so local disk must never be reached there).

Environment variables the app needs in production:

| Variable | Purpose | Where it comes from |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres connection | Neon dashboard → connection string |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Bootstrap admin password (until the first email-verified change) | Set it yourself — see [Authentication](#authentication) |
| `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET` | Signs the admin session cookie | Generate with `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64url'))"` |
| `GMAIL_USER` | Sends the password-reset email | A Gmail address |
| `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` | Auths that Gmail account for SMTP | Google Account → Security → App Passwords (needs 2-Step Verification on) |
| `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET_NAME`, `R2_PUBLIC_URL` | Photo/Aadhar storage | Cloudflare dashboard → R2 → create a bucket + API token, and enable the bucket's public URL (or a custom domain) |
| `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` | Alternative to R2, if hosting on Vercel | Auto-injected once a Blob store is linked to the Vercel project |

The WhatsApp feature uses a zero-credential `wa.me` deep link rather than the
Meta Business API, so it needs no key.

### Deploying on Render (current default)

`render.yaml` at the repo root is a Blueprint — Render → New → Blueprint →
connect this GitHub repo, and it picks up the build/start commands and env
var slots automatically; you just fill in the values in Render's dashboard
(they're marked `sync: false` in the blueprint, meaning Render prompts for
them rather than trying to guess). Free tier: the service spins down after
15 minutes of inactivity and cold-starts on the next request — fine for a
single-studio admin tool, not for something needing instant response at all
hours.

### Deploying on Vercel (alternative)

Also fully supported — this is how the app was originally deployed. The
project's Root Directory must be set to `apps/web`, and `next.config.ts`
uses `@prisma/nextjs-monorepo-workaround-plugin` — without it, Vercel's
build correctly generates the Prisma query engine but the Next.js bundler's
file tracing doesn't discover it (it's loaded via a dynamically-computed
path), so the deployed function crashes with `PrismaClientInitializationError`.
That plugin is the documented fix for exactly this pnpm-monorepo scenario.
On Vercel, set `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` instead of the `R2_*` variables.

## Desktop and mobile apps

`apps/desktop` (macOS) and `apps/mobile` (Android) are **not** separate
copies of the app — they're thin native shells that open the exact same
production URL (`https://yogapratishthan.vercel.app`) in a native window
instead of a browser tab. There is no bundled web build and no local
database inside either one, so there is nothing to keep in sync: the
desktop app, the Android app, and the web link always show identical data
because they're all hitting the same Neon database through the same API
routes.

| | Desktop | Mobile |
|---|---|---|
| Tooling | [Electron](https://electronjs.org) + electron-builder | [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com) |
| Output | `.dmg` (universal — Intel + Apple Silicon) | `.apk` (debug-signed) |
| Points at | `apps/desktop/main.js` → `APP_URL` constant | `apps/mobile/capacitor.config.ts` → `server.url` |
| Icon | `assets/icon/icon.icns` | `assets/icon/android/mipmap-*` |

### Building the macOS app

```bash
cd apps/desktop
pnpm install
pnpm exec electron-builder --mac dmg --universal
# → apps/desktop/dist/Yogapratishthan-1.0.0-universal.dmg
```

The build machine needs Xcode Command Line Tools. `electron-builder` will
auto-sign with any Developer ID certificate it finds in the local keychain;
without one the app is unsigned (Gatekeeper will still allow it via
right-click → Open). It is not notarized — that requires an Apple Developer
account and is a separate, optional step (`electron-builder` supports it
via `afterSign` + Apple ID credentials if you want a plain-double-click
experience with no Gatekeeper prompt at all).

### Building the Android app

Needs a JDK and the Android SDK (`platform-tools`, `platforms;android-34`,
`build-tools;34.0.0`) — install both once via Homebrew + `sdkmanager` if
they're not already on the machine:

```bash
brew install openjdk@17
brew install --cask android-commandlinetools
export JAVA_HOME="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home"
export ANDROID_HOME="/opt/homebrew/share/android-commandlinetools"
yes | sdkmanager --sdk_root="$ANDROID_HOME" "platform-tools" "platforms;android-34" "build-tools;34.0.0"
```

Then:

```bash
cd apps/mobile
pnpm install
pnpm exec cap sync android
cd android && echo "sdk.dir=$ANDROID_HOME" > local.properties
./gradlew assembleDebug
# → apps/mobile/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

This produces a **debug-signed** APK — fine for sideloading directly onto a
device ("install unknown apps" needs to be allowed for whichever app you
use to open it), but not for the Play Store. For that, add a real release
signing config and run `assembleRelease` instead.

> **Installing the APK on a phone:** if the device says something like "you
> may not have an app to open this," it's almost always how the file was
> transferred, not the APK itself — some share sheets (WhatsApp, some cloud
> drive apps) mangle the `.apk` association or don't grant install
> permission to the app you opened it with. The most reliable path is
> `adb install app-debug.apk` over USB, or downloading it directly from a
> plain link in the phone's browser and opening it from the Downloads app.

### Both wrappers share one icon

`assets/icon/icon.svg` is the single source of truth. It's rendered to
every required size with `rsvg-convert`, then packed into `icon.icns`
(via macOS's `iconutil`) for desktop and into `mipmap-*dpi` PNGs for
Android — regenerate both from the SVG if the icon ever changes, rather
than hand-editing the generated files.

## Use cases — how the instructor actually uses this

**A student self-admits** (`/apply`, shared as a link — e.g. a QR code at the
studio): they fill in Personal + Health Information themselves (photo and
Aadhar card optional, everything else required) and submit. It shows up
under **Admission Requests** for the instructor.

**Reviewing an admission request**: open the request, see everything the
student submitted (including their Aadhar card), assign a batch, and
optionally fill in payment/joining date/session count — "Accept" creates the
student and generates their session schedule in one action. "Reject" declines
it with an optional note. The instructor can still admit someone directly at
`/students/new` without going through `/apply` at all.

**Letting a student fix their own details**: from a student's profile,
"Edit access" generates a link the instructor can send via WhatsApp — the
student can update their own Personal/Health info (never batch, payment, or
sessions) until the instructor revokes it or generates a new link, which
invalidates the old one.

**Downloading a student's form**: "Download Form" on their profile opens a
clean printable page with every field plus their photo and Aadhar card —
"Print → Save as PDF" from there produces a file.

**Taking attendance** (`/attendance`): a register per batch — pick the batch
from the tabs, pick a month from the sidebar, and every student who had a
class that month shows as a row with each class date as a column. Click a
past or today's cell to mark present/absent; vacation days show automatically
as "V". No more opening students one at a time.

**A student misses class**: mark them absent (with an optional reason).
From their profile, "Add Make-up" schedules a replacement class — reason is
optional, date/batch/time are picked explicitly. It auto-expires after 2
months if never attended.

**Declaring a holiday** (`/vacations`): pick a date range and reason. Every
session that falls in that range is automatically moved to the student's
next valid class day — this happens for every affected student across the
whole center in one action. Editing or deleting a vacation later correctly
un-does the reschedule wherever it's still safe to (i.e. the replacement
session hasn't been attended yet).

**One student needs time off**: from that student's profile → Vacations tab,
add the same date range and reason — only their sessions shift, the rest of
the batch is untouched. Same safe-revert behavior as a center-wide vacation.

**A student is running low on sessions**: the moment their remaining count
crosses 3, 2, or 1, a notification appears in the bell automatically — no
one has to remember to check. From there, or from the Reminders page, "Send
WhatsApp" opens a pre-filled, editable message to that student's WhatsApp
number.

**Renewing**: from a student's profile, "Renew" adds another batch of
sessions that continues their schedule from their last currently-scheduled
class — not from today, so an early renewal doesn't create a scheduling gap.

## Known limitations / deliberate simplifications

- **WhatsApp is deep-link, not API.** Sending opens WhatsApp with the message
  pre-filled; the instructor still taps send inside WhatsApp. Fully silent
  background sending needs Meta's WhatsApp Business API — a separate business
  account, phone verification, and template approval process, deliberately
  out of scope until it's actually needed.
- **Vacation revert is best-effort.** If a session's replacement has already
  been attended, deleting or editing the vacation leaves it as-is rather than
  rewriting attendance history. This is the correct trade-off, not a bug.
- **One shared admin password, not per-user accounts.** Fine for a
  single-instructor studio; if multiple staff ever need separate logins or
  permission levels, that's a real addition, not a toggle.
- **Document export is print-to-PDF, not a generated file.** `/students/[id]/print`
  is a clean printable page — the browser's own "Print → Save as PDF" produces
  the file. No PDF-generation library running on the server.
- **Reminders are computed, not stored.** The Reminders page always reflects
  live state (no stale cached reminder rows to clean up), but that means it
  recomputes from scratch on every load rather than being instant. Fine at
  the scale of one studio; would need indexing work at much larger scale.
